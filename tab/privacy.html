        This extension does NOT collect your grades or any other academic data
        from you. It only stores the grades as well as other related information
        (regulation, semester and the subject code) in the extension's local
        storage. The data is stored locally on your computer and is not sent to
        any server.
      </p>
      <p>
        The extension however uses geolocation tracking to record page visits
        when you open the <i>CGPA calculations</i> page to view how we calculate
        your CGPA. But don't worry, no personal information about your grades or
        academic records are collected. The data collected through the
        geolocation API is used to estimate the number of users as well as their
        general location. It is to be mentioned that this extension is open
        source, and the code is available on GitHub for anybody to view. I
        believe in transparency, and am always happy to receive contributions
        from the community. If you have any questions or concerns about the
        privacy policy, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Thanks for
        using the extension!
